# SalkowskiCurve_2022
Here is the MATLAB code needed to plot the figures in the paper "On Determining the Equation of a Salkowski Curve Satisfying $\frac{\tau}{\kappa}$=$\frac{1}{s}$."
The code has enough comment to allow the user to understand each step. When you open the file, the parameters that one can change have "(CHANGE)" next to them.
